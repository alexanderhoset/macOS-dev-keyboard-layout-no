# Modified Norwegian Keyboard Layout

If you have ever used the default OS X Norwegian keyboard layout you may have noticed that **{}** is mapped to **alt+shift+8/9** and **[]** to **alt+8/9**. As a developer this is a painful three key combination to get to the most used symbols.

## Installation 

copy no-mod.keylayout to /Library/Keyboard Layouts (system wide)
or ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts (only your user)

It will ask for a administrator password

Enable Norwegian Modified via the Input Sources in the Keyboard module within System Preferences. Norwegian Modified will be listed under others.
(used to have names like Language & Text (International) in previous versions of OS X)
